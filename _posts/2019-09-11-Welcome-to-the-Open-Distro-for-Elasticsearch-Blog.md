Welcome to the new Open Distro for Elasticsearch blog. Open Distro for Elasticsearch is an Apache 2.0-licensed distribution of Elasticsearch and Kibana. This blog will be a source for in-depth, technical content on the project. You’ll find how-tos, release notes, case studies, event announcements, and if you’re inspired, your own content, too! Or you can join the conversation by commenting on blog posts in the [discussion forum](https://discuss.opendistrocommunity.dev/).

Whether you are using Open Distro for Elasticsearch out of the box or building on top of it, we invite you to write about your experience as a guest blogger. Contributing is a great way to share your expertise with the community, spark new conversations, and further the project’s mission. [Send us](mailto:opendistro-blog@amazon.com) your article idea and a brief abstract and get started on your first guest post. We have a handful of editors who can help take your post from rough draft to finished product.

We'll be providing updates on the forks through a few channels:

- [The Open Distro forums](https://discuss.opendistrocommunity.dev/c/forking-elasticsearch-kibana/50). We'll be actively answering questions on the forum as well as providing frequent updates on progress.
- [Biweekly Community Meetings](/for-elasticsearch/events.html). The community meetings will include progress updates at every session as well as leaving time for Q&A. The [next community meeting is on Feb 8, 2021 at 10:00 AM Pacific Time (UTC -8)](https://www.meetup.com/Open-Distro-for-Elasticsearch-Meetup-Group/events/thmcwryccdblb/).

Additionally, we've updated our [FAQ](/for-elasticsearch/faq.html) to reflect the current situation. After we release the forks, the Github repos will be used for any technical coordination or issues leaving the forums for discussion and questions.
